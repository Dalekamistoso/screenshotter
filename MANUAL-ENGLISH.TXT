                                        SCREENSHOTS & TCL TOOL FOR OPENMSX "SCREENSHOOTER"
==========================================================================================================================

What is this software and which is its purpose?---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I programmed this little tool to make automated screenshots of huge lots of roms in order to save time and effort, but 
this little tool also is capable of processing complex tcl commands editing the automated tcl script used by it

I am not affiliated in any way with Openmsx MSX Team, and they are not relationated in any form with this software, so
if you have something to report ask "DrWh0" user in www.msx.org forum.

So please don´t bother OpenMSX team with this

This software is  100% freeware, but if you consider that it worth it I would be happy if you consider any donation 
to my paypal account using the button programmed for that purpose, thanks :)

This program is presented "as is" nor me nor any person, organization or business related to me is responsible in any 
way for damage, malfunction, disgrace, sentimental status, social life or any other thing related or not to this 
program.

In other words:

This is an absolute responsability exemption of all possible cases, like being fired by playing MSX games in labour 
hours in your work, zombie apocalypse, self destruct of your operating system and/or data losses & damages or any kind
of interference in your software and hardware, etc...

This program is free from virus adware or anykind of malware AFAIK, but some antivirus *probably* could detect the
behaviour of this software as "suspicious"

How to use this software?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.- Download ZIP file of the english version or spanish version depending of the language of your choice

2.- Unzip its contents IN THE SAME FOLDE AS OPENMSX (yes all the zip contents)

3.- Create a shorcut in your desktop if you wish (maybe in the future i will add an automated option for it)

4.- Launch openmsx and configure the default MSX machine suited for the software you are going to use
          
    * This is important because:
	
     + If you don´t make a correct machine default profile and you don´t add BIOS CBIOS will be used and only supports ROM
     + If you select a machine without tape CAS & TSX files will not work the same for disk machines or DSK will not work
     + If you choose a directory with roms incompatible with your default machine obviously will fail 

5.- To select the most suitable default machine to execute the script, execute  "openmsx.exe" (not catapult) and select:

    Menu-> Hardware-> Change machine (choose your desired machine) ->Set current machine as default

    Remeber: You need to have the corresponding BIOS to the machine you choose

6.- Execute Screenshooter

7.- Options are separated in two groups, las first 3 ones are the minimal needed to work the rest are needed to customize
    the TCL script, or gather resources needed for it.
    
     In order to start making screenshots follow the procedure, from the first upper button to the third lower one:

     * First button is for choosing the folder with your ZIPPED games (DSK, ROMS, etc...) if you select "Cancel" then 
     root folder will be chosen ("\") and the software will look for zips in that folder (not in subfolders).

     * Second button will generate an automation file with the roms on the folder you choose at begining.
     
     * The third one will execute the automation file itself with the TCL script commands.

     * The fourth one will edit the TCL file or create a new one if none is found.

     * The fifth button is for sending me donations :)

     * The last one will open OpenMSX page in order to download the emulator, documentation, etc...

8.- The lower zone is the "Information Zones" where all process executed are informed to the user


Warning:

* Is normal that this application ask for administrative permissions if you have UAC configured in default levels or high
  ones, this is needed because the application reads folder contents, modify files and execute complex commands, so there
  is nothing to get alarmed about it.
