# screenshotter
A program to automate openMSX TCL scripts with large batch of files

Includes a default tcl ready to use for making screenshots at high speeds with multiple files in a folder, you can by example run a lot of roms/disk/tapes and make screenshots at certain times in "MSX Time" with the default emulated msx machine in openMSX, great also for compability tests, everything unattended and silently in a very short period of time.
